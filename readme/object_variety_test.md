# Overview

The objective of this experiment is to test the generalizability of AffKp on object's variety of instances. We mainly select the mug, spoon and knife as the test object set.
Each set has 8 instances, which vary a lot in geometry, color and texture. Since the mug and cup share the similar geometry, we expand the mug set with additional cup set, which 
owns 5 different instances.
