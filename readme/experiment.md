## Introduction
The physical experiments involve the perception and manipulation modules. The perception module mainly works for predicting the affordance keypoints and converting the computed operational location and direction to the 3D space. The manipulation module is mainly responsible for planning the trajectory to achieve the task. 

## Perception
We uploaded all experiment scripts [here](https://github.com/ivalab/AffKpNet/tree/master/exp). There should be 6 scripts in total. 3 (grasp, contain, w-grasp) for the single object manipulation experiment. 1 for the tableware arrangment task. 2 (cut and pound) for the cutting the string and pounding the nail experiments.

## Manipulation
We used Robot Operating System(ROS) for robotic mainpulation. All source code is uploaded to this [Github repository](https://github.com/ivaROS/ivaHandyExperiment).
